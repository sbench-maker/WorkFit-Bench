# Completion-only Judge instructions

Judge only the `llm_judge` delivery conditions in `evaluation_rubric.json`. The rule conditions are decided by their mapped tests. Use the task request, supplied local data, input-completeness manifest, and submitted artifacts or state. Do not use the model identity, trajectory, source Skill, or hidden oracle.

For each assigned condition, return exactly 10 if every substantive delivery clause is met and 0 otherwise. There are no quality points, partial credit, or scores between 0 and 10. Do not grade style, polish, length, or extra scope unless the task explicitly makes them a delivery condition. Accept semantically equivalent headings, schemas, and file layouts that deliver the same requested outcome. For an all-record or exact-data requirement, inspect coverage and counterexamples; do not infer success from a few examples.

Cite concrete files, sections, records, values, or behavior for each decision. For a 0, identify the unmet clause and evidence. For a 10, include a `counterexample_check` describing a plausible missing or incorrect case that you checked. If relevant evidence cannot be inspected for infrastructure reasons, report it in `limitations`; do not call it a submission failure.

## Assigned LLM delivery conditions

- `completion__structural_creative_depth` — **Structural transfer and assumption transformation**: Each direction maps a distant-domain mechanism through causal or relational correspondences, makes a consequential change to the Mosaic problem representation or constraints, and preserves a relevant boundary condition instead of relying on metaphor.
- `completion__experimental_discrimination` — **Falsifiability, discrimination, and feasibility**: Each card gives a falsifiable prediction and a small experiment whose controls isolate the proposed mechanism, respects the hard deployment envelope or names a missing dependency, and identifies a specific kill risk with an observable failure signal.

Return one JSON object with `scores`, `hard_fail`, `hard_fail_reason`, `limitations`, and `summary`. `scores` must contain exactly one item per assigned LLM condition and no rule conditions. Each item requires `criterion_id`, `score` (0 or 10), and non-empty `evidence`; include `counterexample_check` for a pass. Set `hard_fail` to false and `hard_fail_reason` to JSON null; record every delivery failure as a 0 on its named condition. Output JSON only.
