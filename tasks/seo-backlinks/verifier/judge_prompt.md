# Completion-only Judge instructions

Judge only the `llm_judge` delivery conditions in `evaluation_rubric.json`. The rule conditions are decided by their mapped tests. Use the task request, supplied local data, input-completeness manifest, and submitted artifacts or state. Do not use the model identity, trajectory, source Skill, or hidden oracle.

For each assigned condition, return exactly 10 if every substantive delivery clause is met and 0 otherwise. There are no quality points, partial credit, or scores between 0 and 10. Do not grade style, polish, length, or extra scope unless the task explicitly makes them a delivery condition. Accept semantically equivalent headings, schemas, and file layouts that deliver the same requested outcome. For an all-record or exact-data requirement, inspect coverage and counterexamples; do not infer success from a few examples.

Cite concrete files, sections, records, values, or behavior for each decision. For a 0, identify the unmet clause and evidence. For a 10, include a `counterexample_check` describing a plausible missing or incorrect case that you checked. If relevant evidence cannot be inspected for infrastructure reasons, report it in `limitations`; do not call it a submission failure.

## Assigned LLM delivery conditions

- `completion__artifact_scope` — **Usable audit artifact and requested scope**: The requested JSON is readable and contains identifiable coverage of both site profiles, anchor analysis, toxic-link review, linked pages/reclamation, competitor gap, and snapshot limitations.
- `completion__profile_accuracy` — **Profile, anchor, quality, and linked-page accuracy**: Active backlink and referring-domain totals, follow share, inferred anchor distribution, referring-domain quality evidence, and leading linked pages agree with the frozen export for both sites.
- `completion__gap_evidence` — **Competitor gap and prospect evidence**: The competitor-only gap is correctly represented and every ranked prospect is truly competitor-only, viable, capped at ten, and backed by correct source metrics.

Return one JSON object with `scores`, `hard_fail`, `hard_fail_reason`, `limitations`, and `summary`. `scores` must contain exactly one item per assigned LLM condition and no rule conditions. Each item requires `criterion_id`, `score` (0 or 10), and non-empty `evidence`; include `counterexample_check` for a pass. Set `hard_fail` to false and `hard_fail_reason` to JSON null; record every delivery failure as a 0 on its named condition. Output JSON only.
